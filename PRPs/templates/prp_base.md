## Goal

**Feature Goal**: [Specific, measurable end state of what needs to be built]

**Deliverable**: [Concrete artifact - API endpoint, service class, integration, etc.]

**Success Definition**: [How you'll know this is complete and working]

## User Persona (if applicable)

**Target User**: [Specific user type - developer, end user, admin, etc.]

**Use Case**: [Primary scenario when this feature will be used]

**User Journey**: [Step-by-step flow of how user interacts with this feature]

**Pain Points Addressed**: [Specific user frustrations this feature solves]

## Why

- [Business value and user impact]
- [Integration with existing features]
- [Problems this solves and for whom]

## What

[User-visible behavior and technical requirements]

### Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific measurable outcomes]

## All Needed Context

### Context Completeness Check

_Before writing this PRP, validate: "If someone knew nothing about this codebase, would they have everything needed to implement this successfully?"_

### Documentation & References

```yaml
# MUST READ - Include these in your context window
- url: [Complete URL with section anchor]
  why: [Specific methods/concepts needed for implementation]
  critical: [Key insights that prevent common implementation errors]

- file: [exact/path/to/pattern/file.py]
  why: [Specific pattern to follow - class structure, error handling, etc.]
  pattern: [Brief description of what pattern to extract]
  gotcha: [Known constraints or limitations to avoid]

```

### Current Codebase tree (run `tree` in the root of the project) to get an overview of the codebase

```bash

```

### Desired Codebase tree with files to be added and responsibility of file

```bash

```

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks

```python
# CRITICAL: [Library name] requires [specific setup]
# Example: FastAPI requires async functions for endpoints
# Example: This ORM doesn't support batch inserts over 1000 records
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure

Create the core data models, we ensure type safety and consistency.

```python
Examples:
 - orm models
 - pydantic models
 - pydantic schemas
 - pydantic validators

```

### Implementation Tasks (ordered by dependencies)

```yaml
Task 1: CREATE src/models/{domain}_models.py
  - IMPLEMENT: {SpecificModel}Request, {SpecificModel}Response Pydantic models
  - FOLLOW pattern: src/models/existing_model.py (field validation approach)
  - NAMING: CamelCase for classes, snake_case for fields
  - PLACEMENT: Domain-specific model file in src/models/

Task 2: CREATE src/services/{domain}_service.py
  - IMPLEMENT: {Domain}Service class with async methods
  - FOLLOW pattern: src/services/database_service.py (service structure, error handling)
  - NAMING: {Domain}Service class, async def create_*, get_*, update_*, delete_* methods
  - DEPENDENCIES: Import models from Task 1
  - PLACEMENT: Service layer in src/services/

Task 3: CREATE src/tools/{action}_{resource}.py
  - IMPLEMENT: MCP tool wrapper calling service methods

  - DEPENDENCIES: Import service from Task 2
  - PLACEMENT: Tool layer in src/tools/

Task 4: MODIFY src/main.py or src/server.py

  - FIND pattern: existing tool registrations
  - ADD: Import and register new tool following existing pattern
  - PRESERVE: Existing tool registrations and server configuration

Task 5: CREATE src/services/tests/test_{domain}_service.py
  - IMPLEMENT: Unit tests for all service methods (happy path, edge cases, error handling)
  - FOLLOW pattern: src/services/tests/test_existing_service.py (fixture usage, assertion patterns)
  - NAMING: test_{method}_{scenario} function naming
  - COVERAGE: All public methods with positive and negative test cases
  - PLACEMENT: Tests alongside the code they test

Task 6: CREATE src/tools/tests/test_{action}_{resource}.py
  - IMPLEMENT: Unit tests for MCP tool functionality
  - FOLLOW pattern: src/tools/tests/test_existing_tool.py (MCP tool testing approach)
  - MOCK: External service dependencies
  - COVERAGE: Tool input validation, success responses, error handling
  - PLACEMENT: Tool tests in src/tools/tests/
```

### Implementation Patterns & Key Details

```python
# Show critical patterns and gotchas - keep concise, focus on non-obvious details

# Example: Service method pattern
async def {domain}_operation(self, request: {Domain}Request) -> {Domain}Response:
    # PATTERN: Input validation first (follow src/services/existing_service.py)
    validated = self.validate_request(request)

    # GOTCHA: [Library-specific constraint or requirement]
    # PATTERN: Error handling approach (reference existing service pattern)
    # CRITICAL: [Non-obvious requirement or configuration detail]

    return {Domain}Response(status="success", data=result)

# Example: MCP tool pattern
@app.tool()
async def {tool_name}({parameters}) -> str:
    # PATTERN: Tool validation and service delegation (see src/tools/existing_tool.py)
    # RETURN: JSON string with standardized response format
```

### Integration Points

```yaml
DATABASE:
  - migration: "Add column 'feature_enabled' to users table"
  - index: "CREATE INDEX idx_feature_lookup ON users(feature_id)"

CONFIG:
  - add to: config/settings.py
  - pattern: "FEATURE_TIMEOUT = int(os.getenv('FEATURE_TIMEOUT', '30'))"

ROUTES:
  - add to: src/api/routes.py
  - pattern: "router.include_router(feature_router, prefix='/feature')"
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style (Immediate Feedback)

```bash
# Run after each file creation - fix before proceeding
ruff check src/{new_files} --fix     # Auto-format and fix linting issues
mypy src/{new_files}                 # Type checking with specific files
ruff format src/{new_files}          # Ensure consistent formatting

# Project-wide validation
ruff check src/ --fix
mypy src/
ruff format src/

# Expected: Zero errors. If errors exist, READ output and fix before proceeding.
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests (Component Validation)

```bash
# Test each component as it's created
pdm run pytest tests/services/test_{domain}_service.py -v
pdm run pytest tests/api/test_{action}_{resource}.py -v

# Full test suite for affected areas
pdm run pytest tests/ -v

# Coverage validation
pdm run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Expected: All tests pass. If failing, debug root cause and fix implementation.
```

### Level 3: Integration Testing (System Validation)

```bash
# Docker build + startup
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
sleep 5  # Allow startup time

# Health check validation
curl -f http://localhost:9002/health || echo "Service health check failed"

# Feature-specific endpoint testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F "file=@test.wav" \
  | jq .  # Pretty print JSON response

# Expected: All integrations working, proper responses, no connection errors
```

### Level 4: Creative & Domain-Specific Validation

```bash
# Security scanning
pdm run bandit -r src/

# Performance Testing (if performance requirements)
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:9002/health

# Expected: All creative validations pass, performance meets requirements
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't create new patterns when existing ones work
- Don't skip validation because "it should work"
- Don't ignore failing tests - fix them
- Don't use sync functions in async context
- Don't hardcode values that should be config
- Don't catch all exceptions - be specific
